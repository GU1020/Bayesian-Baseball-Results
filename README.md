# Head to Head Files
Each of the files that have Head To Head in them are the head to head matchups for each season. Each of these files can be recreated by referencing the head_to_head.py file like this:

final_results_dict_2018, final_results_df_2018 =  head_to_head([2018], None, None)

final_results_df_2018.to_excel('2018 Head to Head.xlsx', index = False)

   Description: 
        Pulling all outcomes of every game from the input season from https://www.baseball-reference.com
    
    INPUT: 
        Season (int) - The season of the MLB year you would like to pull
        end_date (string) - Date of the first game that you would like to pull
                       Example: If you would like to skip the season until the month of May,
                       put '20170501' for start_date
                       *** Note: Games must be played on the start date for this to work ***
        end_date (string) - Date of the last game that you would like to pull 
                       Example: If the playoffs in the 2017 season start  October 3, 2017, you want that 
                       to be the stop date. So, for end_date, you would put '20171003' as the stop date.
